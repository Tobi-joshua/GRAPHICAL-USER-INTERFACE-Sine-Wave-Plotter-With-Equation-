# GRAPHICAL-USER-INTERFACE-Sine-Wave-Plotter-With-Equation-
MATLAB app designer that illustrate how a sinewave transforms when the frequency, phase shift, vertical shift, and amplitude changes.
The app contains four slider or spinner components representing the key values in a sine equation, and it calculates the sine function on an x axis that ranges from 0 to 10 with steps of 0.01. The app plots a basic y = sin(x) function and a modified function with the key parameters. The app interface is well organized, and the plot changes continuously as the sliders or spinners are changed.
